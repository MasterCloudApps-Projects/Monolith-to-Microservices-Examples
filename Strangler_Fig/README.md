# Strangler Fig

The ``Strangler Fig`` pattern consists of an incremental and gradual migration of the specific functionalities located within the monolith to independent microservices.

The pattern is divided into 3 steps:
1. Monolithic application, requests and functionalities are responded within it.
2. Implementation of the functionality in a new microservice.
3. With the new implementation ready, we can migrate requests from the monolith to the microservice.

We are going to apply the pattern in different examples with the three steps explained above.

## **Ejemplo 1. Separated funcionality extraction**
____________________________________________________________

In order to perform the migration of requests and hot deployments, we must configure a reverse proxy. The host of our application will be: `payment.service`.

To do this, we must add:
- Linux: `/etc/hosts`
- Windows: `C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts`

The following line: `127.0.0.1 payment.service`

We start from a monolith that contains all the logic of the application. The need arises to extract an independent functionality, in this case ``Inventory`` to a new microservice.

Below there is an image of the initial and final state of the application after applying the pattern.

### **Step 1**
We have our monolithic application, requests and functionalities are answered within it.

```
> docker-compose -f Ejemplo_1/1_docker-compose-monolith.yml up 

> docker-compose -f Ejemplo_1/1_docker-compose-proxy.yml up -d
```

Our proxy is configured to direct all requests to the existing monolith.

```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name payment.service;

  location ~ ^/ {
    proxy_pass http://1-strangler-fig-monolith:8080;
  }
}
```

We can test our monolith through a request to:
```
> curl payment.service/inventory
```

### **Step 2**
We must implement the functionality in a new microservice.
```
> docker-compose -f Ejemplo_1/2_docker-compose-ms.yml up
```

Requests keep coming to our monolith, but we can test our microservice by calling it directly:
```
> curl localhost:8081/inventory
```

We see that the responses come with the tag ``[MS]`` that we have added in the data initializer.

### **Step 3**
With your new implementation ready, we proceed to redirect calls from the monolith to the new microservice.

```
> docker-compose -f  Ejemplo_1/3_docker-compose-proxy.yml up -d
```

The new proxy settings are:
```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name payment.service;

  location ~ ^/(?!(inventory)) {
    proxy_pass http://1-strangler-fig-monolith:8080;
  }

  location /inventory {
    proxy_pass http://2-strangler-fig-inventory-ms:8081;
  }
}
```

Let's try to make a request:
```
> curl payment.service/inventory
```

Now the response will have a prefix ``[MS]`` that we have added to the sample data automatically registered in the microservice.

In case of any problem, you can always do a rollback and redirect the requests back to the monolith.

```
> docker-compose -f  Ejemplo_1/1_docker-compose-proxy.yml up -d
```

## **Example 2. Internal functionality extraction**
____________________________________________________________

If we want to apply the pattern on ``Payroll``, which uses an internal functionality in the ``User notification`` monolith, we must expose said internal functionality to the outside through an endpoint.

</div>

Â¿How does this fit into our 3 steps?:

1. Our monolith, in case of not having a proxy, we must add one that allows directing requests.
2. With the proxy active, we perform the extraction of our microservice. It could be done in several steps:
    - Creation of the empty microservice, without functionality returning ``501 Not Implemented ``. It is recommended to take it to production to familiarize ourselves with the deployment process.
    - Implementation of the microservice functionality.
3. We move requests from the monolith to the microservice progressively. If there is an error we can redirect the requests back to the monolith.

### **Step 1**
We have our monolithic application, requests and functionalities are answered within it.

```
> docker-compose -f Ejemplo_2/1_docker-compose-monolith.yml up 

> docker-compose -f Ejemplo_2/1_docker-compose-proxy.yml up -d
```

We can test our monolith:
```
> curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"shipTo":"Juablaz","total":120}' payment.service/payroll
```

Log in to the notification:
```
Payroll 3 shipped to Juablaz of 120.0
```

### **Step 2**
We must implement the functionality in a new microservice that will communicate with the monolith. Therefore, the monolith must expose an endpoint for the microservice to connect through it ``/notification``.
We released a version of the monolith (``v2``) and our new microservice.

```
> docker-compose -f Ejemplo_2/2_docker-compose.yml up
```

We can test our microservice:
```
> curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"shipTo":"Juablaz","total":220}' localhost:8081/payroll
```

The notification is logged in the new monolith (``v2``), therefore the communication is correct:
```
Payroll 3 shipped to Juablaz of 220.0
```

Requests through the proxy ``payment.service`` continue to reach the previous monolith, but we have tested the correct operation of the new monolith and the microservice.

### **Step 3**
With the new implementation ready, we redirected requests to the `Payroll` functionality monolith.

```
> docker-compose -f  Ejemplo_2/3_docker-compose-proxy.yml up -d
```

The new configuration is:
```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name payment.service;

  location ~ ^/(?!(payroll)) {
    proxy_pass http://2-strangler-fig-monolith:8082;
  }

  location /payroll {
    proxy_pass http://2-strangler-fig-payroll-ms:8081;
  }
}
```

We can test our application:
```
> curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"shipTo":"Juablaz","total":320}' payment.service/payroll
```

The notification is logged in the monolith ``v2``:
```
Payroll 3 shipped to Juablaz of 320.0
```

At this point we can consider removing version 1 of the monolith:

```
> docker-compose -f  Ejemplo_2/1_docker-compose_monolith.yml down
```

And what happens if we have had a problem in the new version?
We can quickly load the old proxy settings:

```
> docker-compose -f Ejemplo_2/1_docker-compose-proxy.yml up -d
```

In this way, the petitions go back to the old monolith.
